3. I graduated in medicine from BSMU in 2014. I've benn working as a doctor during 5 years.
 Once I've decided that I want changes in my life: to have a bigger salary, to have a job where I can improve my skills and that will help to forge a successful career. 
 I have always taken an interest in IT. I want to be taken on interesting projects. 
 My strength: firstly, I'm very good at working with other people, I'm an excellent communicator, very calm, hard working, organized, keep cool head in very stressful situations. 
 My weaknesses: hurry. After 5 years working in IT, I suppose I'll continue and grow in my career. I'm a kind a person, who needs new challenges. As on option I 'd like to create my own start up, maybe IT-school.
